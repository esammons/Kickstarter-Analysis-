# -An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Performing analysis on Kickstarter Data to illustrate trends. 
## Overview of Project 
In this project data is used to help illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Kickstarter campaigns in various geograpgical locations with various financial startup costs and outcomes. 
### Analysis and Challenges 
An analysis of the data was performed using various line charts, pivot tables, pivot charts, and bar graphs. Some of the more challenging parts of constructing helpful visuals and useful data was creating the Outcomes based on goals sheet. Gettting all of the countifs formulas proved to be challenging at first. However once the initial countifs formula was created in excel I was able to change the variables fairly easily to illustrate the different column requirements.  
#### Results
* While theater outcomes appear to have a consistent number of failed outcomes, successful outcomes appear to peak during the summer months May to July. 
* The Outcomes based on goals sheet helps to illustrate that most successful outcomes occur with a lower budget, as the initial financial goal trends upwards so does the percentage of failed outcomes. 
* Some of the limitations of this dataset include factoring and comparing the start dates of launches and the various forms of media consumption as it evolves.
* Perhaps a helpful table or graph to create would be a comparison between the number of backers vs the total amount of money raised, this could help illustrate which projects are actually in demand by more people and which projects simply have higher pledges but a smaller audience.
